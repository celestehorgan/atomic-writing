# Content

There are two types of content in any organization **structured** and **unstructured**.

Atomic writing does not preference either type. Modern documentation stacks should handle both, and the interleaving of both, with equal ease.


## Unstructured Content 

Unstructured content is any content that does not follow a specific pattern. 

For a technical writer, this can be a daunting concept, but there are all sorts of perfectly valid reasons that content
might not follow an established pattern or (heaven forbid) not be strictly a Concept, Reference or Task. 

For example: 
* Tutorials, which ideally weave through ordered steps, pedagogic explanations, introductory concepts, explaining and presenting alternatives, etc. 
* Recipes, which provide both a reference code sample and a break-down of the code sample
* Philosophy essays, like this one, which introduce a way of thinking that might be relevant to your users, but are decidedly _not_ concepts.
* Compatability matrices, and other documents designed to guide users through a descision-making process. 
* FAQs and other question-and-answer type documentation (knowledge base articles, i.e.)
* Walk-through blog posts which talk about what _one person did_ in _one specific instance_, and provide wisdom/learnings.

You'll notice some of these examples are things which do _have_ structure, however â€“ for example, FAQs typically have blocks of 
question-and-answer formats
Unstructured content can include modules of structured content, but structured content does not include unstructured content.


## Structured Content

Structured content is any content that must conform to a pattern. Patterns are defined and described by the teams doing the writing. 

Examples of structured content are as follows:

* UI tasks with numbered steps
* API References
* Release notes

Structured content is _not_ a content taxonomy or classification in the traditional Information Mapping/DITA sense. API Referneces can have conceptual information in them if the team decides it's nessecary, for example. Structured content follows a predictable pattern which can be validated against and (in some cases), automated. 

## Content blocks

A content block is a chunk of content and a header.
