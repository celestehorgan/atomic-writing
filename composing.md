## The pitfalls of structured writing and semantic metadata

Before we talk about composing layers, let's talk about the one greatest irritations normal people have when engaging with structured authoring markup languages: the pitfalls of semantic metadata.

Semantic metadata is often touted as one of the biggest advantages of structured writing markups: by tagging things semantically, we can render blocks of content based on their meaning, and validate formatting based on the semantic type of content present. 

What structured authoring through use of semantic metadata misses, however, is this makes documents _irritating to read._ Documents which are irritating to read are irritating to collaborate on, without specialized knowledge. 

Traditionally, this means that no one but trained technical writers touch documentation. However, a "hands off" policy simply doesn't work in software, let alone in highly autonomous, self-organizing Agile development environments. 

Documentation is a cross-cutting concern. It reaches its fullest potential to help the user when stakeholders from various groups – development, support, client services – can contribute anything from a quick grammar fix to long chunks of documentation. Trapping documentation away behind arcane markup formats does not achieve this.

_seperation of semantic metadata and human-readable content_. 


## Seperation of concerns

In Atomic Writing, atoms (Content blocks) are always human-readable content. To the extent possible, we seperate writing from presentation. 

However, in most modern web application architectures, presentation and content aren't
