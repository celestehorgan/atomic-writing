## The pitfalls of structured writing and semantic metadata

Before we talk about composing layers, let's talk about the one greatest irritations normal people have when engaging with structured authoring markup languages: the pitfalls of semantic metadata.

Semantic metadata is often touted as one of the biggest advantages of structured writing markups: by tagging things semantically, we can render blocks of content based on their meaning, and validate formatting based on the semantic type of content present. 

What structured authoring through use of semantic metadata misses, however, is this makes documents _irritating to read._

_seperation of semantic metadata and human-readable content_.
